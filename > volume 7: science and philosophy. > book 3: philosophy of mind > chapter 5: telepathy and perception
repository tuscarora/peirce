Chapter 5: Telepathy and Perception†1
§1. Telepathy
597. A little passage at arms between a physicist of standing and a celebrated psychologist has lately focussed the public glance once more for a moment upon this subject.†2 The remarks of Prof. Trowbridge express, more or less successfully, the typical physicist attitude toward the hypothesis of telepathy and toward psychical research. I shall consider rather that typical attitude than the special points which this excellent physicist has made. For I was trained from boyhood in physics, have mostly associated with physicists, and fully share their prejudices, whether legitimate or illegitimate. Upon the formation of the Society for Psychical Research, I disapproved of physicists lending it their countenance, on the ground that in doing so they would be encouraging young men to devote the best years of their lives to an inquiry of little promise in which those men would be in great danger of compromising themselves, since it would appear that they must either have some positive result to defend after so much time had been spent or else be reduced to a distressing acknowledgment of failure. When the large book "Phantasms of the Living" appeared, I wrote a long and minute criticism of it,†3 arguing that it only showed that no scientific conclusion could be reached by the examination of stories of sporadic and unanalyzed phenomena. Thus I have little need of consulting with others to do full justice to the typical physicist's disapproval of the hypothesis and the methods of the telepathists. On the other hand, ever since Wundt inaugurated the modern science of psychology about 1862 (the date of the collected publication of his Beiträge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung,) I have pursued that study both experimentally and speculatively, and am thus better able than some physicists to appreciate the opinions of the psychologists.

598. Let me endeavor to explain the attitude of the physicist. Many people imagine that there is a certain class of facts which it is repugnant to the physicist to acknowledge. This is not so. If there were such a class of facts, the phenomena connected with radium would fall within it. Yet there has been no disposition to ignore these phenomena. But the physicist recognizes that a phenomenon is of no use to him unless both it and its conditions can be subjected to exact analysis. Moreover, the only theories that can have any value for him are those from which can be deduced exact predictions capable of exact verification. As long as a fact stands isolated and strange, it is next to impossible to make sure that it is a fact, and quite impossible to render it useful to science. Physicists are doubtless inclined to discredit facts of which they, as physicists, could make no use. But that is a mere matter of personal belief with them. It cannot affect their conduct as physicists. Thus, in regard to aerolites, as long as there were merely scattered tales of stones having fallen from heaven at long intervals, although some of them were very strongly attested, as when a shower of them were dashed into a public square of Siena, it must be admitted that physicists of the very highest genius were too much inclined to pooh-pooh the matter. But this they did not do in their character as physicists, since there seemed to be no way by which a physicist could inquire into the matter. It was merely a "belief." One physicist, however, Chladni, bethought him to draw up a catalogue of all these tales, — using, not "post-card evidence," since post-cards were not yet in use, but testimonies that, taken singly, were mostly far from affording satisfactory scientific security. The result was that it appeared that stones fall from heaven every day (we now know that thousands fall daily). Thus, the subject became opened to scientific investigation, and the personal adverse "beliefs" of the physicists, gave way to the general acknowledgment that the fact had been established.

599. Suppose we knew nothing at all about electricity except for the stories of fire-balls. Then it could make no difference to physicists, as physical inquirers, whether those stories were true or not, since there would be no way by which further physical inquiry into their nature could be pursued. It would not be their concern, professionally; but personally their "belief" would mostly be that they were fancies.

600. The theory of telepathy is that in some cases one mind acts upon another, whether directly or not, at any rate by means fundamentally different from those that every-day experience renders familiar. As a scientific theory, this almost condemns itself. For to say that a phenomenon is fundamentally different from anything in ordinary experience is almost to say that it is of such a nature as to preclude the deduction from it of manifold exact predictions verifiable by ordinary perception. Pretty nearly the sole support claimed for this theory consists of certain tremendous experiences that are said to have happened to a minute fraction of mankind. If such be the only facts in the case, they are facts with which science can have nothing to do, since science is the business of finding out Law, i.e., what always happens.

601. Suppose it were true that those marvellous stories proved the doctrine of telepathy; then what would it be that had been proved? Why, that very rarely mind acts upon mind in a way utterly unlike the normal way. This would be no contribution to science. It would, in the case supposed, have been ascertained that sometimes a marvel, an impenetrable mystery, occurs. The concern of science, however, is with intelligible facts. Science no more denies that there are miracles and mysteries than it asserts them. But it is a Postulate, — a hope, — of science and of all sound reasoning that any given fact to which our attention may be directed shall turn out to be intelligible.†4 It is justly held criminal for a commander-in-chief to "despair of the republic"; and it would be as monstrous for an inquirer to despair of the comprehensibility of his problem. The psychicists are fond of reminding us that the most familiar facts are full of mystery. So they are, in a metaphysical sense; and that is the very reason why the physicist eschews metaphysical inquiry and seeks to understand phenomena only in the sense of establishing their exact relations to one another. Hence, what is absolutely severed and sundered from the body of ordinary experience is absolutely beyond scientific comprehension.

602. Sharing these sentiments common to all physicists, when 'Phantasms of the Living' appeared, — that vast collection of well-sifted stories by which Messrs. Gurney, Myers, and Podmore endeavored to prove the theory of telepathy, — I felt that I would far sooner believe in spiritualism. For according to this latter theory, we all pass into another life; nor would this experience common to us all be much more wonderful than the development that we all undergo when the child becomes a grown person. If telepathy be a fact, why should it have the strange character of being excessively infrequent, so contrary to the ubiquity of all the other agencies of nature? One cannot suppose it otherwise than extremely infrequent without having long ago become well-known and beyond doubt. Nor have the psychicists succeeded in making out the slightest trace of it in ordinary people. If, on the other hand, we suppose there are communications from the other world, there is nothing surprising in their being infrequent. For with what disgust and indifference must the departed spirit recall the pettiness and blindness of the ends, the villainy, meanness, and filth of the methods of the inhabitants of this [world], who, as he well sees, are at the bottom of their hearts glad to get rid of him, and who have to work out their own salvation without interference, — the nasty little imps.†5 Surely, the canyon that spiritualism has to suppose between the two worlds has a gentle slope compared with the abyss that telepathy opens in the midst of experience between the ordinary and extraordinary intercommunion between minds.

603. Messrs. Gurney, Myers, and Podmore in asking human reason to admit that a class of phenomena was sundered from ordinary experience vastly more than any phenomena had been believed to be, seemed to me to be all but asking reason to admit that its hope of understanding things, — its only aim, — was futile; and I was accordingly moved to write an elaborate criticism of their book to show that hallucinations were so very common, while hallucinations coincident with truth beyond the ken of sense were so very rare, after the suspicious cases had been weeded out, that these coincidences might very well be supposed to be fortuitous. At the same time, I essayed to determine by logical analysis what were the conditions to which a census of hallucinations must conform in order to afford sound support to the contention of the telepathists that the veridical †6 hallucinations were too numerous to be accounted chance coincidences. The Society at once set about making a new census. I wish I could pay them the compliment of averring that, in doing so, they were influenced by my reasons or by any better considered reasons. But I am obliged to say that they so far failed to conform to the conditions which I had shown to be requisite, — and in the direction of favoring their doctrine of telepathy, — that now the question stands as it did before, a question which each man will answer according to his predilections, whether these owe their birth to his general experience of the ways of nature or to some episode of his private life.

§2. The Scientific Attitude
604. I am sorry. For the question at issue between the physicist and the psychologist in the recent passage of arms was how far the psychical researchers have the character of men of science. Now however much ratiocinative analysis may help toward a decision upon this point, the answer must ultimately rest, like every other judgment concerning men's character, upon the testimony of instinctive impressions; and one of my purposes in this article is to render the testimony of my own impressions upon the matter. Thus finding myself in a situation that calls for truth-telling, truth will I tell, without exaggeration or extenuation, as accurately as I can, whatever it costs me.

605. There are two qualifications which every true man of science possesses, and which, if a man possesses them, he is sure to develop into a scientific man in the course of time, if he ought not fairly to be called such already. First, the dominant passion of his whole soul must be to find out the truth in some department, regardless of what the color of that truth may be. Secondly, he must have a natural gift for reasoning, for severely critical thought. Perhaps a man who had drunk of the fountain of perpetual youth need not, at the outset of his career, possess either of those qualifications: he would infallibly become a man of science at last, because the incessant action of experience would ultimately produce those two qualities in him. For we see that, in a measure, that effect has been produced in the course of history upon civilized man at large.

606. In a measure, I say, for the love of truth is still far from mighty; and a gift for reasoning is still as rare a talent as a gift for music. Most men are incapable of strong control over their minds. Their thoughts are such as instinct, habit, association suggest, mainly. Their criticism of their thoughts is confined to reconsideration and to asking themselves whether their ideas seem reasonable. I do not call this reasoning: I call it instinctive reflexion. For most purposes it is the best way to think; for instinct blunders far less than reason. Reasoners are in danger of falling into sophistry and pedantry. Our instinctive ways of thinking have become adapted to ordinary practical life, just as the rest of our physiology has become adapted to our environment. Wisdom lies in nicely discriminating the occasions for reasoning and the occasions for going by instinct. Some of my most valued friends have been almost incapable of reasoning; and yet they have been men of singularly sound judgment, penetrating and sagacious. So much more important is it, on the whole, to feel right than to reason deeply. But in science instinct can play but a secondary rôle. The reason of this is that our instincts are adapted to the continuance of the race and thus to individual life. But science has an indefinite future before it; and what it aims at is to gain the greatest possible advance in knowledge in five centuries or ten. Instinct not being adapted to this purpose, the methods of science must be artificial. As Professor Trowbridge hints, pure science has nothing to do with belief. What I believe is what I am prepared to go on today. Imagine a general besieging a city. He sits in his tent at night preparing the details of his plan of action for the morrow. He finds that what his orders ought to be and perhaps the whole fate of his army depend upon a certain question of topography concerning which he is in need of information. He sends for his best engineer officer, — a highly scientific man, — and asks how he is to ascertain the fact in question. The officer replies, "There is only one possible way of ascertaining that. So and so must be done." "How long will that take?" "Two or three months." The general dismisses the man of science, — as Napoleon dismissed Laplace, — and sends for another officer, not half so scientific, but good at guessing. What this officer shall say, the general will go by. He will adopt it as his belief.

607. Beyond the two general qualifications mentioned, every scientific man needs a special training in his particular branch of research; and moreover this branch will probably call for the possession of some special mental, physiological, and instrumental advantages for the acquisition of a special line of facts. I do not set down "power of observation" among the general qualifications, because this phrase covers a variety of capacities having nothing in common, of which a naturalist will want one, an astronomer another, a linguist a third, a psychologist a fourth, and so on. Besides, there has been some exaggeration about the observing powers of scientific men; and in that quality which the phrase seems best to fit, the power of noting one's precise sensations unaffected by any interpretation of them, the scientific men of most branches are decidedly inferior to the artists. I should not, therefore, attribute any very high importance to great general powers of observation as distinguishing men of science. But I must say that the best psychical researchers rank high in this respect as compared with scientific men generally.

608. In considering how far they possess the essential characters of scientists, I first note that amateurs, idlers, and people not extra wise naturally flock to the Society for Psychical Research and make up an even greater proportion of it than they do of other large scientific associations. But these are not the persons under consideration. It is only the men who have devoted all the strenuous energies of their lives to the work, some of whom have succumbed to the strain of it, whom I am to endeavor to class.

609. As to their devotion to truth, I have to remember that, as I have known them, they have been serious and foreseeing men who would not embark upon any enterprise without carefully reckoning up its contingencies. Therefore, at the moment when any one of those men deliberately devoted his life and his whole being to this inquiry, as several have done, he certainly had distinctly before his mind the following considerations: that it would be hard and incessant work, mostly drudgery, requiring him to be occupied mostly with knaves and fools; that it would cost him a great deal of money, considering all that it would prevent him from earning; that it would never bring him much honor, but would put a certain stamp of obloquy upon him; that even among the company of those who professed to love the truth, and who ought to press him to their hearts as a brother, there would be found in the more richly endowed sciences, individuals who would treat him in the narrowest and most despicable spirit of the east wind; that after his whole life had been poured out into the inquiry, it was not unlikely that he might find that he had not found out anything.

610. These considerations go to show that, whatever those men have been aiming at, they have aimed at in a single-hearted manner. Were they desirous of believing in the particular doctrine of telepathy, or were they bent on finding out the truth, whatever it might be?

611. I cannot see that there is anything particularly comfortable about a belief in telepathy. To be sure, it cuts off, or greatly weakens, the force of such evidence as there might seem to be for spiritualism; and, no doubt, for many reflecting persons, the prospect of another life is rather unpleasant. But who will believe that the main motive of the telepathists has been to escape thoughts of another world? Such thoughts are not troublesome enough for that.

612. I had a somewhat prolonged controversy with Edmund Gurney which was only interrupted by his death; and this brought me into fine touch with the spirit of the man. I was most strongly impressed with the purity of his devotion to truth. This impression has been thoroughly convincing in the cases of others whom I have met personally, but whom I do not name because they are still living.

613. The power of reasoning of the leaders is certainly much above that of the average of men. It does not seem to me to have been altogether sufficient for their problem. The hypothesis of telepathy does not seem to me to have much merit, as a specimen of scientific method. I believe that if the researchers had been better reasoners they would not have spent so much time in sifting tales of extraordinary happenings but would rather have thrown their energies into an endeavor to connect the dubious extraordinary phenomena with ordinary experience. In this direction, the little that they have done seems to me feeble and to show defect of analysis.

614. As for scientific training and special qualifications, the psychicists seem to me to have been amply provided with all that their method gave room for. Their exposure of several frauds has been neat and workmanlike, and they have made use of numbers as far as numbers have been applicable. Prof. Trowbridge complains that they make no measurements; and that coincides with my complaint that they have not sufficiently endeavored to bring their marvels into relation to ordinary experience. For, in order to do that, the phenomena would have had to be analyzed; and then, and not before, would measurements have been applicable. Prof. Trowbridge will not forget that in the early stages of physics, there were no measures. Galileo, Gilbert and others made considerable progress before they arrived at a stage at which they were able to make any measurements to speak of. But they did exhibit great skill in analyzing the phenomena; and I agree that the psychicists have not exhibited signal ability in doing that. It must be remembered, however, that they are only breaking ground in a perfectly virgin soil intractable and thicket-tangled. They are doing good honest work, not shrinking from labor, and proceeding intelligently, if not with high genius. The farm of physics has long been under cultivation, the costliest implements and the most refined methods are here in use. Here have come these new settlers, occupying land not easy to till and poor in resources. Come, let us turn up our noses at them, gossip about their suspicious ways, and let them feel the difference between them and us. Who knows whether they are honest?

§3. Perception
615. If there were only some way of reconciling the usual order of nature, as it is familiar to us, with the possibility of rare cases of quasi-vision beyond the ken of sense, then I grant that the testimonies adduced in "Phantasms of the Living" would suffice to render it extremely likely that such rare quasi-vision actually takes place. For, after all, the theory of chance coincidence puts a certain strain upon our instinct of receiving testimony; and natural instinct is not a thing to be lightly disregarded.

616. Is it quite certain that such an occasional, but very rare, determinedly veridical vision of things beyond the senses' ken would be altogether unlike every-day experience? As to that I have a suggestion to make.

617. It is not uncommon to hear a man or woman say, "I believe what I see, and nothing more." But little cross-questioning would commonly be needed to show that it is an exaggeration. There are not many persons, even though they boast themselves to be materialists, who do not really believe much that they do not themselves think that they directly perceive by any sense, peripheral or visceral; — polonium, the sacred city of Thibet, George Washington, the glacial period, that motions will tomorrow conform to Newton's three laws. But I myself happen, in common with a small but select circle, to be a pragmatist, or "radical empiricist,"†7 and as such, do not believe in anything that I do not (as I think) perceive: and I am far from believing in the whole of that.

618. Only, the question arises, What do we perceive? It would not serve our turn to answer scholastically with an arbitrary definition which might be ill-considered. Let us rather set out from familiar instances, and having noticed what their relation is to the formation of scientific opinions, found upon that a definition which shall cover all that is so related to knowledge and shall cover nothing else.

619. Let us say that, as I sit here writing, I see on the other side of my table, a yellow chair with a green cushion. That will be what psychologists term a "percept" (res percepta). They also frequently call it an "image." With this term I shall pick no quarrel. Only one must be on one's guard against a false impression that it might insinuate. Namely, an "image" usually means something intended to represent, — virtually professing to represent, — something else, real or ideal. So understood, the word "image" would be a misnomer for a percept. The chair I appear to see makes no professions of any kind, essentially embodies no intentions of any kind, does not stand for anything. It obtrudes itself upon my gaze; but not as a deputy for anything else, not "as" anything. It simply knocks at the portal of my soul and stands there in the doorway.

620. It is very insistent, for all its silence. It would be useless for me to attempt to pooh-pooh it, and say, "Oh come, I don't believe in the chair." I am forced to confess that it appears. Not only does it appear, but it disturbs me, more or less. I cannot think the appearance is not there, nor dismiss it as I would a fancy. I can only get rid of it by an exertion of physical force.

621. It is a forceful thing. Yet it offers no reason, defence, nor excuse for its presence. It does not pretend to any right to be there. It silently forces itself upon me.

622. Such is the percept. Now what is its logical bearing upon knowledge and belief. This may be summed up in three items, as follows:

1st, it contributes something positive. (Thus, the chair has its four legs, seat, and back, its yellow color, its green cushion, etc. To learn this is a contribution to knowledge.)

2nd, it compels the perceiver to acknowledge it.

3rd, it neither offers any reason for such acknowledgment nor makes any pretension to reasonableness. This last point distinguishes the percept from an axiom. I am a total disbeliever in axioms; but so far as the proposition, say, that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points even so much as seems to be self-evident, it seems to be reasonable. It is as founded in reason or in the nature of things, or as founded in something, that it recommends itself. The percept, on the contrary, is absolutely dumb. It acts upon us, it forces itself upon us; but it does not address the reason, nor appeal to anything for support.

623. Let us say, then, that anything is, for the purposes of logic, to be classed under the species of perception wherein a positive qualitative content is forced upon one's acknowledgment without any reason or pretension to reason. There will be a wider genus of things partaking of the character of perception, if there be any matter of cognition which exerts a force upon us tending to make us acknowledge it without any adequate reason.

But in order fully to satisfy ourselves of the justice of classing in this species and in this genus all that I propose to refer to them, it is desirable to examine a little more closely the characters of the percept.

624. A visual percept obtrudes itself upon me in its entirety. I am not therein conscious of any mental process by which the image has been constructed. The psychologists, however, are able to give some account of the matter. Since 1709, they have been in possession of sufficient proof (as most of them agree,) that, notwithstanding its apparent primitiveness, every percept is the product of mental processes, or at all events of processes for all intents and purposes mental, except that we are not directly aware of them; and these are processes of no little complexity. The psychologists very reasonably argue that the first impressions made upon sense must have been feelings of sense qualities, — say colors, sounds, etc. — disconnected from one another, and not appearing to stand over against a self as objects; and it would seem that this must have been true of the very first impressions ever made upon sense in the history of mental development, however far the sense of the individual man of today may have been rendered capable of immediately apprehending the complex. But this is quite inferential. We are, of course, directly aware of positive sense-qualities in the percept (although in the percept itself they are in no wise separate from the whole object); but as for their being at first disconnected and not objectified, that is psychological theory.

625. Thus, two utterly different kinds of elements go to compose any percept. In the first place, there are the qualities of feeling or sensation, each of which is something positive and sui generis, being such as it is quite regardless of how or what anything else is. On account of this self-sufficiency, it is convenient to call these the elements of "Firstness."†8 In the percept, these elements of Firstness are perceived to be connected in definite ways. A visual percept of a chair has a definite shape. If it is yellow with a green cushion, that is quite different from being green with a yellow cushion. These connectives are directly perceived, and the perception of each of them is a perception at once of two opposed objects, — a double awareness. In respect to each of these connections, one part of the percept appears as it does relatively to a second part. Hence, it is convenient to call them elements of "Secondness." The vividness with which a percept stands out is an element of secondness; because the percept is vivid in proportion to the intensity of its effect upon the perceiver. These elements of secondness bring with them the peculiar singleness of the percept. This singleness consists in a double definiteness. For on the one hand, the percept contains no blank gaps which, in representing it, we are free to fill as we like. What I mean will be seen if we consider any knowledge we can have of the future. I heard somebody say that the Brooklyn bridge would fall some day. The only way in which he could even think he knew that would be by knowing that any bridge I might select that should be constructed in a certain way would fall. There is no such universality about the percept. It is quite individual. On the other hand, the definiteness of the percept is of a perfectly explicit kind. In any knowledge of the past something is, as it were, held in reserve. There is an indicated gap which we are not free to fill but which further information may fill. We know that the Sphinx was made by some king of Egypt. But what one? The percept, however, exhibits itself in full. These two kinds of definiteness, first, that the percept offers no range of freedom to anybody who may undertake to represent it, and secondly, that it reserves no freedom to itself to be one way or another way, taken together, constitute that utter absence of "range" which is called the singularity, or singleness, of the percept, the one making it individual and the other positive. The percept is, besides, whole and undivided. It has parts, in the sense that in thought it can be separated; but it does not represent itself to have parts. In its mode of being as a percept it is one single and undivided whole.

626. The percept is not the only thing that we ordinarily say we "perceive"; and when I professed to believe only what I perceived, of course I did not mean percepts, since percepts are not subjects of belief or disbelief. I meant perceptual judgments. Given a percept, this percept does not describe itself; for description involves analysis, while the percept is whole and undivided. But once having a percept, I may contemplate it, and say to myself, 'That appears to be a yellow chair'; and our usual language is that we "perceive" it to be a yellow chair, although this is not a percept, but a judgment about a present percept.

627. The perceptual judgment is all but in the same relation to knowledge and belief as is the percept. It is true that I may, by an effort of will, abstain from thinking about the color of the chair, so that the judgment 'the chair appears yellow' is not unconditionally forced upon me, and thus might seem not quite fully to partake of the character of perception. One can, however, escape the percept itself by shutting one's eyes. If one sees, one cannot avoid the percept; and if one looks, one cannot avoid the perceptual judgment. Once apprehended, it absolutely compels assent. Its defect in forcefulness is thus excessively slight and of no logical importance.

628. To about the same degree its forcefulness falls short of the utter irrationality of that of the percept. The perceptual judgment professes to represent the percept. A logical defence of it would therefore have to be founded either on the percept as a premiss of that logical defence, or else on the percept as a fact represented by such premiss. But the percept cannot be a premiss, since it is not a proposition; and a statement of the character of the percept would have to rest on the perceptual judgment, instead of this on that. Thus, the perceptual judgment does not represent the percept logically. In what intelligible manner, then, does it represent the percept? It cannot be a copy of it; for, as will presently appear, it does not resemble the percept at all. There remains but one way in which it can represent the percept; namely, as an index, or true symptom, just as a weather-cock indicates the direction of the wind or a thermometer the temperature. There is no warrant for saying that the perceptual judgment actually is such an index of the percept, other than the ipse dixit of the perceptual judgment itself. And even if it be so, what is an index, or true symptom? It is something which, without any rational necessitation, is forced by blind fact to correspond to its object. To say, then, that the perceptual judgment is an infallible symptom of the character of the percept means only that in some unaccountable manner we find ourselves impotent to refuse our assent to it in the presence of the percept, and that there is no appeal from it. Thus, the forcefulness of the perceptual judgment falls short of the pure unreasonableness of the percept only to this extent, that it does profess to represent the percept, while the perfection of the percept's surdity consists in its not so much as professing anything.

629. The perceptual judgment, then, does not quite accurately fulfill the condition of forcefulness nor that of irrationality, as it should do to be strictly entitled to be considered a product of perception. But the differences are so minute and so unimportant logically that it will be convenient to neglect them. Perhaps I might be permitted to invent the term percipuum†9 to include both percept and perceptual judgment.

630. I promised to show that a perceptual judgment is entirely unlike a percept. If it be true, as my analysis makes it to be, that a percept contains only two kinds of elements, those of firstness and those of secondness, then the great overshadowing point of difference is that the perceptual judgment professes to represent something, and thereby does represent something, whether truly or falsely. This is a very important difference, since the idea of representation is essentially what may be termed an element of "Thirdness," that is, involves the idea of determining one thing to refer to another. The element of secondness in the percept consists in one part being relative to another. But the percept presents itself ready made, and contains no idea of any state of things being brought about. There is a rigid mathematical demonstration (which I cannot give here) that the idea of Firstness, or that of a positive suchness, and the idea of Secondness, or that of one thing's referring to another, can in no way be combined so as to produce the idea of one thing A, referring to a second, B, in the very act of referring to a third, C.†10 This is the element of Thirdness, or mediation, which the conception of the representation of something to somebody obviously involves. In a perceptual judgment the mind professes to tell the mind's future self what the character of the present percept is.†11 The percept, on the contrary, stands on its own legs and makes no professions of any kind.

631. There are several other points of contrast between the perceptual judgment and the percept that are calculated to exhibit their disparateness. The judgment, "This chair appears yellow," separates the color from the chair, making the one predicate and the other subject. The percept, on the other hand, presents the chair in its entirety and makes no analysis whatever.

632. We have seen that the "singularity" of the percept is a composite of two modes of definiteness. The first consists in this, that its faithful and full interpreter has no freedom allowed to him, but all is prescribed. But the perceptual judgment 'This chair appears yellow' has vaguely in mind a whole lot of yellow things, of which some have been seen, and no end of others may be or might be seen; and what it means to say is, 'Take any yellow thing you like, and you will find, on comparing it with this chair, that they agree pretty well in color.' It thus directly invites the exercise of a freedom of choice on the part of the interpreter (any one yellow thing answering as well as any other) which freedom the percept sternly and stupidly precludes.

633. The other mode of definiteness of the percept consists in its being perfectly explicit. The perceptual judgment carelessly pronounces the chair yellow. What the particular shade, hue, and purity of the yellow may be it does not consider. The percept, on the other hand, is so scrupulously specific that it makes this chair different from every other in the world; or rather, it would do so if it indulged in any comparisons.

634. It may be objected that the terms of the judgment resemble the percept. Let us consider, first, the predicate, 'yellow' in the judgment that 'this chair appears yellow.' This predicate is not the sensation involved in the percept, because it is general. It does not even refer particularly to this percept but to a sort of composite photograph of all the yellows that have been seen. If it resembles the sensational element of the percept, this resemblance consists only in the fact that a new judgment will predicate it of the percept, just as this judgment does. It also awakens in the mind an imagination involving a sensational element. But taking all these facts together, we find that there is no relation between the predicate of the perceptual judgment and the sensational element of the percept, except forceful connections.

635. As for the subject of the perceptual judgment, as subject it is a sign. But it belongs to a considerable class of mental signs of which introspection can give hardly any account. It ought not to be expected that it should do so, since the qualities of these signs as objects have no relevancy to their significative character; for these signs merely play the part of demonstrative and relative   pronouns   , like "that," or like the A, B, C, of which a lawyer or a mathematician avails himself in making complicated statements. In fact, the perceptual judgment which I have translated into "that chair is yellow" would be more accurately represented thus: "inline image is yellow," a pointing index-finger taking the place of the subject. On the whole, it is plain enough that the perceptual judgment is not a copy, icon, or diagram of the percept, however rough. It may be reckoned as a higher grade of the operation of perception.

636. In order not to prolong the discussion, I leave some possible objections to what I have said unanswered. The most serious of these is that a perceptual judgment may be revised; so that there is a certain check upon it. The examination of this point would be lengthy, and it does not seem to me likely to appear to anybody to be of fundamental importance. Full justice to it would involve complications which few would have the patience to follow.†12

§4. A Programme
637. Having thus formed some acquaintance with the characteristics of perception, we go on to a line of thought of which the programme may be set down in advance.

638. No scientifically valuable classification can draw a line of demarcation between forms which differ indefinitely little. I shall begin by showing that this principle, which I shall refer to as the "serial principle,"†13 obliges us to class as perceptions many ideas not popularly regarded as belonging to this class.

639. By the continued application of the same principle, I shall widen more and more our notion of what perception includes. In particular, I shall endeavor to bring into a clear light the truth that although what I have already said implies the truth of that doctrine of the direct, or "immediate," perception of the external world which is taught by the Aristotelians, by Kant, and by the philosophers of the Scotch school, yet we cannot refuse the name of perception to much which we rightly reject as unreal; as indeed, dreams and hallucinations are quite commonly classed as perceptions.

640. In this way, I shall lead up to the consideration of a certain group of ideas, — I beg permission to withhold the specification of what group it is, for the moment, — which ordinary instinctive language speaks of as perception, but which, as soon as one undertakes to be extra precise in one's speech, one usually never thinks of so classing; and I hope to give good reason for holding that, in this particular, instinct is right and pedantry wrong. Of this group of ideas, however, the great majority are illusory, the small minority determinedly veridical and not merely true by chance coincidence. The physicist would stultify himself if he were not the last of all men to call this into question.

641. With this group of ideas I proceed to compare the entire host of hallucinations, which there is no good reason to separate into the veridical and the non-veridical, and which there is good reason to account far more frequent than the census of the Society for Psychical Research admits. They shade off into bévues of which ordinary people commit from one to dozens daily. In view of this comparison and of all the characteristics that have been developed of ordinary perceptions in their now enlarged domain, I shall inquire, to begin [at] the end, whether it will be more in accordance with general experience to expect that some fraction of hallucinations should have a pronounced tendency to being determinedly veridical or that none should be so. Thence I shall go on to the two questions that are really pertinent to the present positions of opinion, first, whether, in case we were to admit, what is very far from commanding any reasonable assent, that all the stories which the telepathists consider marvellous and that are supported by testimony of real weight are real histories, there would be any ground for admitting a mode of communication between minds, in those cases, differing radically from modes that are ordinary; secondly, whether it be consonant with ordinary experience to be so extremely sceptical about the determinedly veridical character of occasional visions of what is beyond the ken of the senses as the rank and file of the physicists are apt to be.

§5. The Percipuum
642. If there is any novelty in the suggestion I am about to make, — and I must confess I fear there is, — it lies only in the juxtaposition of ideas. The facts which I shall adduce are to the psychologist the merest commonplaces. In the classification of them I endeavor to eliminate the pedantries and formalisms which are retained in the books for convenience, but to which psychologists attach no particular importance; and this I do by the application of the above principle of forming almost continuous series, which principle is the principal clew of which the biological taxonomists, — the great masters of classification and of terminology, — are accustomed to avail themselves. Addressing, as I do, a reader who I dare say has read a book or two about psychology but who has not dwelt enough upon the subject to prevent his being impressed by the more tangible, wooden, and dead ideas, — or corpses of ideas, — rather than by the more elusive, fluid, and living ones, my principal care will be to correct such notions. If the reader comes with a fresh mind unsophisticated by any such reading, he will follow my meaning all the easier.

643. We know nothing about the percept otherwise than by testimony of the perceptual judgment, excepting that we feel the blow of it, the reaction of it against us, and we see the contents of it arranged into an object, in its totality, — excepting also, of course, what the psychologists are able to make out inferentially. But the moment we fix our minds upon it and think the least thing about the percept, it is the perceptual judgment that tells us what we so "perceive." For this and other reasons, I propose to consider the percept as it is immediately interpreted in the perceptual judgment, under the name of the "percipuum." The percipuum, then, is what forces itself upon your acknowledgment, without any why or wherefore, so that if anybody asks you why you should regard it as appearing so and so, all you can say is, 'I can't help it. That is how I see it.' For example, one of the foolish questions with which treatises on physics used to abound was why things look right side up, when the images on the two retinas are upside down; and sundry sapient reasons more or less abstruse were given for their looking as they do. Now such arguments might have proved that things really are right side up, or perhaps they might have shown what physiological and psychical agencies cause us to regard them as right side up; but if anybody were to ask you why you should regard the visual images as right side up like the things themselves, rather than upside down like the optical images on the retinae, how you were justified in doing so, your only possible answer would be "They do look so, and I cannot make them look otherwise," whether it is reasonable for them to look so or not. Sometimes when I have been seated in a railway-car that was stationary and another train has been slowly passing by, I have been vexed at the unreasonableness of its appearing to me that our train was moving and the other train was at rest. I have reasoned with my perception. I have asked, "Is there jarring such as there is when one is in a moving car?" No. "Is there any noise of the wheels?" No. "Is there anything at all in the looks of either train that is more as if we were moving rather than they?" Quite the reverse. "Then why do I have the idea that that train is at rest and that we are moving?" There is no answer except that such is the percipuum, and I cannot help it.

644. There is no difference between a real perception and a hallucination, taken in themselves; or if there be, it is altogether inconsiderable. The difference is that rational predictions based upon the hallucination will be apt to be falsified, — as for example, if the person having the hallucination expects another person to see the same thing; while truly sound predictions based on real perceptions are supposed never to be falsified, although we have no positive reason for assuming so much as that. But this difference between hallucinations and real perceptions is a difference in respect to the relations of the two cases to other perceptions: it is not a difference in the presentations themselves. For the purposes of physiological psychology it may be proper and needful to put them into different classes. That is a branch of science with which I am not concerned. But for logical purposes, that is, in regard to their relations to knowledge and belief, which is the concern of this whole paper, they should be regarded as one and the same phenomenon, in themselves.

645. So likewise all hallucinations, the non-veridical, the fortuitously veridical, and the determinedly veridical, are, for our purposes, all one and the same phenomenon, in themselves.

646. But this is not all. The serial principle will not permit us to draw a hard and fast line of demarcation between perception and imagination. Physiological psychology may be justified or compelled to separate them, for aught I know or care. But, in regard to their relation to knowledge and belief, the percipuum is nothing but an extreme case of the fancy.

647. We all know, only too well, how terribly insistent perception may be; and yet, for all that, in its most insistent degrees, it may be utterly false, — that is, may not fit into the general mass of experience, but be a wretched hallucination. In other cases, the insistence of the percipuum may be something of a sham. That is, it may resist all unskillful attempts to overthrow it, be they ever so energetic; and yet when one knows the right trick it will be curious to see how easily it is downed. For example, that moving train that appears stationary will not move however one may try to force it to do so. Yet if one only looks down and watches the wheels turn, in a very few seconds it will seem to start up. The percipuum, insistent as it is, is not nearly so persistent and thing-like as one is apt to think. There is a well-known outline figure of a straight flight of steps against a wall seen in perspective from the side. It is called 'Schroeder's Stair.'†14 When you look at it you seem to be looking at the stairs from above. You cannot conceive it otherwise. Continue to gaze at it, and after two or three minutes the back wall of the stairs will jump forward and you will now be looking at the under side of them from below, and again cannot see the figure otherwise. After a shorter interval, the upper wall, which is now nearer to you, will spring back, and you will again be looking from above. These changes will take place more and more rapidly, the aspect from above always lasting longer, until at length, you will find you can at will make it look either way. But put it aside for a quarter of an hour or less and you will find you have lost this power. Doubtless frequent repetition of the experiment would give one complete control over it. You will thus have converted an uncontrollable percipuum into a controllable imagination by a brief process of education. It is one of the recognized difficulties of all psycho-physical measurement that the faculties rapidly become educated to an extraordinary degree. Thus, contrast-colors, when properly exhibited, are incredibly vivid. One is not easily persuaded that they are not real. Yet the experimenter becomes, in time, almost incapable of perceiving them. This is a case in which the same educational course which gives control over appearances which sometimes do and sometimes do not accord with the mass of experiences, only serves to strengthen the forcefulness of those appearances which always do so accord.

648. It is a difficult question whether the serial principle permits us to draw sharp lines of demarcation between the percept and the near anticipation, or say the antecept, and between the percept and the recent memory (may I be permitted to call this the ponecept, a distant and dubious memory being perhaps quite another thing?), or whether the percept is at once but an extreme case of an antecept and an extreme case of a ponecept. Or rather, — I beg the reader's pardon for my awkwardness of statement, — the precise question is not about percept, antecept, and ponecept, but about percipuum, antecipuum, and ponecipuum, the direct and uncontrollable interpretations of percept, antecept, and ponecept. There can surely be no objection to our beginning the discussion by asking what the deliverance of a flow of time, say for example of the motion of a shooting star, is concerning the matter; for this inquiry cannot result in our knowing less about the main question than we did before. The psychologists think it will not cause us to know any more, either; because the question is not what the percipuum represents the nature of the transformations of antecipuum into percipuum and of percipuum into ponecipuum to be, but what in fact they really are. It will be observed that, in so putting the question, the psychologists are assuming that time really is as our common-sense metaphysics, or rather as their own interpretation of common-sense metaphysics, represents it to be. What they doubt is whether the percipuum accords with the facts; that is, with their interpretation of the general mass of experience; or, since experience is nothing but the interpretation of the percipua, what they doubt is whether the percipuum accords with an interpretation of an interpretation of itself, just as one asks whether the Greek testament faithfully accords with the Authorized Version, whether Jesus was a sound christian and could sign the thirty-nine articles, whether Plato, Isocrates, Thucydides and the rest of the prosaists of that period wrote good grammar, and the like.†15 I fear I shall not be able to follow them far into this deep and dark exploration.

649. If we wish to know what the percipuum of the course of time is, all we have to do is to abstain from sophisticating it, and it will be plain enough. No more than the present moment directly confronts us. The future, however little future it may be, is known only by generalization. The past, however little past it may be, lacks the explicitness of the present. Nevertheless, in the present moment we are directly aware of the flow of time, or in other words that things can change.†16 Several other points are clearly delivered in the percipuum, but they are implied in what has been stated. Sundry schools of philosophy hold this testimony of the percipuum to be contrary to sound reason, and accordingly either set it down as false, or conclude that the facts really are absurd, or both. But it strikes me that while it is not the business of facts to conform to what M or N may approve as sound reasoning, it is the business of M's and N's logic to conform to facts.

650. Fully to unfold all the implications of the deliverance of the percipuum so as to demonstrate the accuracy of the interpretation would require a small treatise, if written in the English style, or three stout octavos in German. But I will endeavor to summarize what the upshot of the discussion would be so as to render it tolerably perspicuous.

651. Kant squarely hit the nail on the head when he said that every part of a lapse of time was a lapse of time. But here as in many parts of his philosophy, Kant did not quite understand himself, and imagined that in saying that every part of a time is a time he had only said that time was infinitely divisible.†17 . . .†18

652. But although Kant unwarily confused the idea that time, as "intuited" (to use his language, for he himself translates his Anschauung by the Latin intuitus), has no parts that are not themselves times with the very different idea that there is a way of dividing time so as never to reach an ultimate part (though such parts there may be), yet his reasoning, taken as a whole, is consistent only with the idea that time as intuited has no ultimate parts, or instants. That opinion I share, substituting the percipuum for his intuition. Thus, that which the mathematicians call "continuity" becomes, for me, "pseudo-continuity."

653. Of course, if there is no such thing as an absolute instant, there is nothing absolutely present either temporarily or in the sense of confrontation. In fact, we are thus brought close to the doctrine of Synechism, which is that elements of Thirdness cannot entirely be escaped. The present moment will be a lapse of time, highly confrontitial, when looked at as a whole, seeming absolutely so, but when regarded closely, seen not to be absolutely so, its earlier parts being somewhat of the nature of memory, a little vague, and its later parts somewhat of the nature of anticipation, a little generalized. It contains a central part which is still more present, still more confrontitial, but which presents the same features. There is nothing at all that is absolutely confrontitial; although it is quite true that the confrontitial is continually flowing in upon us.

654. I aver, but do not show, that if my statement of what I call the essential part of the delivery of the percipuum be true to it, then the interpretation given is demonstrably the only one possible. But though I do not actually demonstrate it, I will mention some secondary features of the deliverance of the percipuum which strongly tend to confirm the interpretation.

655. One such deliverance is that any multitude of changes not too great to be successive in any sense might take place in any lapse of time however short. Now two things are demonstrable (although again I withhold the demonstrations). One is that no multitude is so great as to prevent a collection of objects of that multitude from being linearly arranged.†19 The other is that there is no maximum multitude. It follows, then, from the deliverance just stated, that the possible mutually exclusive divisions of any time, however short, exceed all multitude. In that case, time can not only not have merely the pseudo-continuity of quantity, — since the multitude of quantities †20 is well-known to be only the second of an endless series of grades of infinite multitude, — but it cannot be composed of instants at all (as it might very well be and still enormously exceed the differentiation of quantity) since the entire collection of such instants would have a multitude.

656. Another plain deliverance of the percipuum is that moment melts into moment. That is to say, moments may be so related as not to be entirely separate and yet not be the same. Obviously, this would be so according to our interpretation. But if time consists of instants, each instant is exactly what it is and is absolutely not any other. In particular, any two real quantities differ by a finite amount.

657. Still another deliverance of the percipuum is that every interval of time has a beginning and an end, an initial moment and a terminal moment; that is, a moment before which there is no moment of the interval and a moment after which there is no moment of the interval. This again is obviously true of our interpretation; and were the terminal moment thrown off, that is, not reckoned as belonging to the interval, still what was left would have a terminal moment. If only one moment were thrown off at the end, the new terminal moment would not be altogether different from what had been the terminal moment. Of course, the expression "only one moment" can only be understood in a relative sense. This precisely agrees with the percipuum, according to which if from a terminated line, the terminal point be thrown off, what remains still has a terminal which is substantially identical with the old terminal. I appeal to the reader's consciousness to say if that be not so. But if time is composed of instants, and the last instant of an interval be thrown off, the interval will be left without any last. For if it had any, then before the last was thrown off, there would be no instant between this original last and the instant which becomes the last after the throwing off. But to say that there is not a moment between any two distinct moments is too monstrously in conflict with the percipuum for any reasoning man to maintain. Such a notion would be exploded in a dozen ways.

658. By this time, while I have not exhausted my stock of reasons for thinking that the deliverance of the percipuum concerning the flow of time must be interpreted as I say, yet I have said enough to convince any superior reasoner, — or as nearly to convince him as his caution will allow him to be convinced until he has had time for reconsideration. Further confirmation will soon appear; but we may turn now to the question of whether the testimony of the percipuum is truthful or not. It is obvious that a percept cannot be false, since it makes no assertion and is not a proposition, whether indicative, interrogative, optative, imperative, or in any mood whatever; and few philosophers will today think otherwise. It is indeed one of the stock remarks that even a hallucination is not false. It would save me trouble in my present argumentation if I could take that short cut to the truth; but I fear I cannot quite do so.

659. We must enter for a few moments into the field of metaphysics. For we are inquiring how things really are whatever we may think. What is reality? There would not be any such thing as truth unless there were something which is as it is independently of how we may think it to be.†21 That is the reality, and we have to inquire what its nature is. We speak of hard facts. We wish our knowledge to conform to hard facts. Now, the "hardness" of fact lies in the insistency of the percept, its entirely irrational insistency, — the element of Secondness in it. That is a very important factor of reality. But this factor is not confined to the percept. We can know nothing about the percept, — but only experience it in its totality, — except through the perceptual judgment, and this likewise compels acceptance without any assignable reason. This indefensible compulsiveness of the perceptual judgment is precisely what constitutes the cogency of mathematical demonstration. One may be surprised that I should pigeon-hole mathematical demonstration with things unreasonably compulsory. But it is the truth that the nodus of any mathematical proof consists precisely in a judgment in every respect similar to the perceptual judgment except only that instead of referring to a percept forced upon our perception, it refers to an imagination of our creation. There is no more why or wherefore about it than about the perceptual judgment, "This which is before my eyes looks yellow." To show this I must take an example of a mathematical proof; and for the reader's comfort I will take an extremely simple one. At the same time it must be of as abstract a nature as possible, or it might be said that whether intuitional mathematics were perceptual or not, this was not the nature of all mathematics.

660. I will start with the following premiss, which is true of whole numbers: If any predicate, P, be true of the number 0, zero, but not of all numbers, then there must be two numbers M and N such that N is next greater than M, and P, while true of M, is not true of N.

661. From this I proceed to prove, first, that there is no number except zero that is not next greater than some number other than itself. For if there were any such number, call it A. Then the predicate "is not A" would be true of 0 (since A is supposed other than 0) but not of all numbers (since it would not be true of A). Yet there would be no number of which it would be true that it was not A while there was a number next greater than this number of which this was not true (since A is, by hypothesis, not next greater than any other number than itself).

662. I will further prove from the same premiss that there is no number except zero that cannot be reached from zero by a finite multitude of successive steps, each passing from a number to [a] number next greater than it. By a "finite" multitude is meant the multitude of any collection [for which, that collection] being substituted for "Hottentot" in the following syllogism, this syllogism would be valid: Every Hottentot kills a Hottentot; No Hottentot is killed by more than one Hottentot; Therefore every Hottentot must be killed by a Hottentot.

663. I will first demonstrate that if a single individual is joined to a finite collection, the collection will remain finite. For that purpose, I first remark that the premisses of the above syllogism say nothing about the individual differences of the single Hottentots; and therefore if a newcomer were substituted for one of the Hottentots and the conclusion logically followed from the premisses before the substitution, so they would after the substitution. (There are other ways of making this evident.) Now suppose the tribe were increased by a new man. If the collection thereby ceased to be finite, the premisses might continue to be true of the new Hottentots (that is, of the tribe as so increased) and yet some man might escape being killed. We may suppose for convenience that this is the newcomer (since we have seen that a mere substitution as to who kills who makes no difference). Then no Hottentot kills the newcomer; but every Hottentot still kills some Hottentot. Hence he must kill one of the old Hottentots. So as before every old Hottentot kills an old Hottentot and the old Hottentots being a finite collection, every old Hottentot gets killed by an old Hottentot. But no man is killed by two different men; so that there is nobody for the newcomer to kill. Thus the premisses cannot be true of the increased collection unless the conclusion be true; which is as much as to say that the collection remains finite.

664. Now, to return to the numbers, suppose there be such a number as I undertake to prove there is not. Call it A (or if there be more than one, call any one of them A). Let the predicate, P, be "is either zero or can be reached from zero by a finite collection of steps from [a] number to [a] next greater number." This predicate is true of zero, but not of A. Yet there is no number of which it is true and yet not of a next greater, since to suppose this would be to suppose a finite collection of steps would cease to be finite on the adjunction of one more. Thus the supposition that there is such a number as A is absurd, and the proposition is proved.

665. These proofs are founded on nothing but an abstract proposition. But an abstract proposition is a subject for observation as much as anything else. The proofs consist in remarking implications which were not thought of in the proposition as first adopted. Our premiss said that no matter what predicate and what number be chosen, either that predicate is true of that number or not true of zero or else two numbers could be found of one of which, which was next greater than the other, the predicate would not be true while it would be true of the other. In thinking this, we did not think whether or not it was possible that there should be a number not greater than any other. But when this is suggested, we are led to remark that being not next greater than any number and yet not zero is itself a predicate and the negative of a predicate. This is the kind of observation peculiar to mathematics, the looking at things substantively that have only been regarded transitively, or transitorily, the operation of abstraction.†22 How do we know that is a predicate? Precisely as we know that what is before our eyes is yellow. We can, after the fact, invent a formula to cover the case; but it will still leave something undefended. It is really a compulsion similar to that of the perceptual judgment with which we have to do.

Both the arguments happen to be stated in the form of the reductio ad absurdum, which is very appropriate to mathematics as bringing out its ultimately irrational character. But it is a mere form of statement. Every reductio ad absurdum can be stated as a direct argument. The reduction of the figures of [the] syllogism illustrates, if it does not virtually demonstrate, this truth.

666. But it is not in respect to this immediate insistence alone that the real is as it is independently of how we think it to be. The future is real, as well as the present, in so far as it is predetermined; and who but a mad man will deny that it largely is predetermined, at least to some degree, if not irrevocably. Indeed, the tendency of modern philosophy has been to follow the stoical doctrine that the future is what it is to be, independently — of something; I do not think it is clearly said of what. The explanation of this state of mind, as far as the stoics were concerned, is not difficult. The early stoics in their efforts to make the universe comprehensible endeavored to discard elements of Thirdness, with a more or less unconscious feeling of Ockham's razor. The resulting hard dualism suited the hard lot of slaves and of the oppressed; and as time went on and this class and their descendants became more influential, a stern morality, which is essentially dualistic, naturally flourished amid the hideous riot of that age, while thirdness was utterly shoved into the background. The chief rival of stoicism, Epicureanism, sought to get along in its philosophy even without elements of secondness. About 1600, it was the scholastic realists who were the defenders of thirdness, and their dunsical opposition to the new learning and their dreadful corruption of the university disgusted the new men. Hence the fight was between Gassendi, the Epicurean, and Descartes, the real though unconscious stoic. I refuse to believe the future is entirely predetermined; but it certainly is so in great measure; and in so far as it is so, it is independent of all that we can think, wish, or do. It has the kind of compulsiveness that belongs to inductive reasoning, or experimental inquiry, really the most mighty cogency there is. For experimental inquiry sets out with a hypothesis; upon which it bases predictions as to the issue of experiments, and it is left to the future experiment to bring forth the conclusion from the womb of the future. This factor of reality is specially prominent in the reality of personality. It is what the man is destined to do, what of the future is wrapped up in him, that makes him what he is.

667. The difference between the insistency of what is before us and the power of predestination is manifest enough. But there is a third factor of reality, different from either of those. The past also is real, — something in it, at least. The future weeds it out; but the positive element is peculiar. Memory would be nothing but a dream if it were not that predictions are based on it that get verified. When we think how slight and entangled must be the ultimate bits of feeling out of which memory constructs her mosaic, we are compelled to liken it to conjecture. It is a wonderful power of constructing quasi-conjectures or dreams that will get borne out by future experience. The power of performing this feat, which is the power of the past, is a gentle compulsiveness.

668. There are the three elements of reality: that by which ideas spring up that have concealed within them an accord with the mass of ideas; that by which one idea acts directly on another; that force from without that weeds out a part of the ideas and strengthens the rest.

669. To state the matter otherwise: An idea, a surmise springs up in my mind. It recommends itself to me more or less forcibly as reasonable. The fact that it recommends itself to me more or less surely warrants its pretty near accord with what will recommend itself to reasonable minds as well as to the quasi-mind behind the issues of the future. That idea acts upon other ideas and absolutely forces me to say that it requires certain things to happen in the future. The future events come to pass and in part negative my surmise, in part confirm it. I do not know what idea we can form of reality except that it is that threefold force; or what the real can be except that which the whole process tends, as we hope, to induce our thoughts to rest upon.

670. Such being the nature of the real, since the percipuum confesses itself to contain a soupçon of memory, — that is, of conjecture, — as well as a soupçon of onsight, or watching to see if the future comes as expected, it must be confessed that according to the percipuum's own account of itself, not only may this or that percipuum be false, — and should be so regarded in the case of blunders, if not of hallucinations, — but it is even conceivable that all percipua should contain a false element, perpetually refuted by oncoming fresh percipua, although these fresh percipua perpetually introduce the like falsity anew.

671. But it is remarkable that in case we do not accept the percipuum's own account of itself, but maintain that time is composed of absolute instants, then it would seem that there is nothing that empirical truth can mean except accordance with what is given in those instants, which in this case, in no way testify concerning one another or in any way refer to one another. If that be so, a percept must be absolutely true. Here, then, we have a witness who testifies, "There is a certain dose of falsity in my testimony, I know," and a large and influential party of philosophers who protest, "Oh, no such thing! Whatever you testify to is absolute truth."

672. Suppose, however, that some fallacy lurks here, and that the doctrine of instantaneous consciousness does not logically require absolute assent to all the representations of perception. Still, it must be admitted that the only method of ascertaining the truth is to repeat this trio of operations: conjecture; deductions of predictions from the conjecture; testing the predictions by experimentation (not necessarily what is technically so called, but essentially the same thing, — trial).†23 We, thus, necessarily repose upon man's power of guessing the truth. Let him analyze the question as far as practicable; and give him guesses enough (not very many) upon each simple item and eventually he will guess right. Since we thus unavoidably assume that the mind has a certain power of evolving the truth from its own entrails, natural ideas, such as the deliverances of the percipua, have a right of precedence, and should be adhered to until fact flatly contradicts them. But thus far all the facts of observation are in remarkable accord with the deliverance of the percipuum as it is above stated.

673. If my view is right, time is of the nature of a general. That is, it may be a day; and a day is, by virtue of there being a forenoon and an afternoon; and a forenoon or afternoon is, by virtue of the different hours; the hour, by virtue of its minutes; and so on endlessly. But you never can find an indivisible time.

674. It is true that we may imagine a pendulous motion. The motion to the right ceases and the motion to the left begins. If the pendulum is an absolutely rigid body all whose parts are constrained to move in precisely the same way, then, were time composed of rational dates only, there need not be any date at which the right hand motion ended and the left hand motion began. In a true continuum there must be a common moment, but not an absolute instant, independent of all that is before and after. Looking at matters through the wrong end of a telescope, as it were, — that is, aggregating the parts, — there certainly is something in a moment altogether independent of past and future. But examining the moment under a microscope we find this independent element divided up into portions, less independent of one another. Finally, we come to this, that while there are elements of secondness, — of irrational compulsion — they flow in upon us continuously, thus being subjected from the very first to thirdness. Take away considerable time, — as a day; — and doubtless much therein happens that could not have been expected. But if we divide the day into hours, we find that much that was unexpected on the whole is no more than might have been anticipated from a part; and so we are led to say that the unexpected comes, not only in driblets, but in inappreciable flow.

675. On the whole, then, the percipuum is not an absolute event. There is no span of present time so short as not to contain something remembered, that is, taken as a reasonable conjecture, not without containing something expected for the confirmation which we are waiting. The peculiar element of the present, that it confronts us with ideas which it forces upon us without reason, is something which accumulates in wholes of time and dissipates the more minutely the course of time is scrutinized.

676. There is no percipuum so absolute as not to be subject to possible error.

677. The percipuum is a recognition of the character of what is past, the percept which we think we remember. The interpretation is forced upon us; but no reason for it can be given.

678. But just so when we experience a long series of systematically connected phenomena, suddenly the idea of the mode of connection, of the system, springs up in our minds, is forced upon us, and there is no warrant for it and no apparent explanation of how we were led so to view it. You may say that we put this and that together; but what brought those ideas out of the depths of consciousness? On this idea, which springs out upon experience of part of the system we immediately build expectations of what is to come and assume the attitude of watching for them.

679. It is in this way that science is built up; and science would be impossible if man did not possess a tendency to conjecture rightly.

680. It is idle to say that the doctrine of chances would account for man's ultimately guessing right. For if there were only a limited number n of hypotheses that man could form, so that 1/n would be the chance of the first hypothesis being right, still it would be a remarkable fact that man only could form n hypotheses, including in the number the hypothesis that future experimentation would confirm. Why should man's n hypotheses include the right one? The doctrine of chances could never account for that until it was in possession of statistics of the hypotheses that are inconceivable by man. But even that is not the real state of things. It is hard to say how many hypotheses a physicist could conceive to account for a phenomenon in his laboratory. He might suppose that the conjunctions of the planets had something to do with it, or some relation between the phases of variability of the stars in {ö} Centauri, or the fact of the Dowager empress having blown her nose 1 day 2 hours 34 minutes and 56 seconds after an inhabitant of Mars had died. The truth is that very few hypotheses will appear to the physicist to be reasonable; and the one true hypothesis is usually of this small number. Why is that? It may be answered, very truly, that experience has taught us that astrology, correspondences, magic, and many hypotheses formerly considered reasonable are to be put aside. Yes, but if primitive man had not had, at the very outset, some decided tendency toward preferring truthful hypotheses, no length of time, — absolutely none, — would have been sufficient to educate him even to the state of mind of Aristotle in his Book of Physical Auscultations, ridiculous as all that now seems to us. No, it is absolutely necessary to admit some original connection between human ideas, and the events that the future was destined to unfold.

681. But that is something very like telepathy. What would telepathy amount to, if it were an established fact. It would then be proved that people not very infrequently have hallucinations, and that one hallucination out of a great number (but more frequently than chance coincidence could account for) coincides with subsequent experience to such a degree as to attract attention; for even if there really be telepathy we must suppose, from what we know of human nature, that the accordance with truth is apt to be greatly exaggerated. In this case, telepathy would be a phenomenon somewhat more remote from perception than the conjectures by which physicists so often hit upon the truth.

§6. Conclusion
682. Very well, then; what does all this rambling lead to? Nobody, of course, denies the phenomena, which the telepathists bring before us; that is to say, that such and such stories are told. The only question is whether they are to be accounted for by the operation of causes usually active in such phenomena.

683. The doctrine of telepathy is not established, nor far on the way toward establishment, as a scientific truth. For understood as the telepathists make a point of defining it, it denies the hope on which all science is based. If, however, we amend it, in order to avoid that positively anti-scientific character, what does it amount to? That very rarely a person at a distance from another has a hallucination or a positive conviction apparently irrational which represents something as having happened to that other person, and this turns out to be veridical with a frequency and to a degree which we know not how to explain, and which seems mysterious. But science can make no use of a proposition so vague as that. Where is the phenomenon, or the feature of a phenomenon, in which, if we examine closely, we shall not find much that our science cannot yet explain?

684. There is, however, no part of the work of science that ought to rank higher than that which brings a phenomenon to the cognizance of science. That sort of work, which Chladni did for the falling stones, is what the psychicists are endeavoring to do for veridical hallucinations and the like; and they will no doubt persevere until they succeed. I do not think they have displayed great genius for research; but they ought to be respected for the thorough single-heartedness, conscientiousness, and constancy with which they have pursued this purpose.

685. The general public has no accurate conception of what the work of a scientific investigator consists in; for the books of "popular science" give no idea of it. But the general public is no fool in judging of human nature; and the general public is decidedly of the opinion that there is such a thing as a scientific pedantry that swells with complaisance when it can sneer at popular observations, not always wisely. I must confess that in the past generations scientists of great eminence have sometimes been betrayed into this fault; but it will not be so hereafter. As for Sir William Crooks his most exquisite experimental researches were still in the future when he first displayed an openness of mind more admirable still. Neither Newcomb nor Langley was a worn-out and super-annuated physicist when he took a prominent position in the Psychical Research Society; neither had at that time achieved his most brilliant experimental triumphs.

686. What school of philosophers is it that attributes to the human mind the most wonderful powers? One might guess that it would be the idealists and spiritualists; but strange to say it is those who boast themselves to be materialists and who insist that nothing is real except mass and motion. For in order to maintain that, they are obliged to say that law is nothing but a figment of the human mind. Now law can certainly not be jammed into the pigeon-hole of mass, nor into that of motion. That indeed is their real reason for making it a fiction. Now is it not of all things the most wonderful, that the mind should be able to create an idea for which there is no prototype in nature, nor anything in the least resembling it, and that by means of this utter fiction it should manage to predict the results of future experiments and by means of that power should during the nineteenth century have transformed the face of the globe? Telepathy, with its infrequency and usual deceptiveness (for there is no reason for separating veridical from non-veridical hallucinations, as phenomena essentially different,) would be an insignificant faculty in comparison.

687. For my part, I cannot accept such a theory. It attributes to man powers which he knows too well that he does not possess. It seems to me that the only admissible view is that the reasonableness, or idea of law, in a man's mind, being an idea by which objective predictions are effected, — for all physical theories originate in human conjectures, and experiment only lops off what is erroneous and determines exact values, — must be in the mind as a consequence of its being in the real world. Then the reasonableness of the mind and that of nature being essentially the same, it is not surprising that the mind, after a limited number of guesses, should be able to conjecture what the law of any natural phenomenon is. How far this power of conjecture may go we certainly do not know. We do know that it goes far enough to have enabled men to make already considerable progress in science. Whether or not it extends so far that very rarely one mind can know what passes in another at a distance, would seem to be a question to be investigated as soon as we can see our way to doing so intelligently. I do not believe that questions can be permanently settled by pooh-poohing one or another alternative.

688. It is curious to see how the materialists, — or those who are flattered at being so called, — plume themselves on being free from "beliefs." Really, one would suppose they imagined it possible for a man to conduct his life on a basis of scientifically established doctrine. It is true that an engineer, civil, mechanical, electrical, or chemical, is able to do this in the present advanced state of science, so far as he has to deal with materials. But even a member of one of those four professions, the only ones that can be called thoroughly reduced to the applications of scientific principles, even he still finds that exact science fails him in dealing with men, — that is to say in considering the use to which his construction is to be put, in considering financial questions, in considering his relations to those who are to execute his plans. For everything else in life unscientific beliefs have to be relied upon for the present; and in particular, it is precisely what we are to believe about telepathy that we all are curious to know.†24
